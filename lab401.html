<h2></h2>Did you know Halloween origianted in Ireland?
<p></p>Recenttly I read about halloween in a national geographic article. It explained how there is a sacred "mound" of dirt that thousands of years ago was used to host annual rituals. Scientists believe these rituals are the predececcors to halloween.

<h2></h2>There used to be giant sloths.
<p></p>I think sloths are pretty cool and weird animals, but even weirdeer aree giant sloths. Bonees of these giants have been found and scientists estimate they used to be up to 10 feeet long!
