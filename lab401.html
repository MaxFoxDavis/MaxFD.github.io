<h2></h2>Did you know Halloween origianted in Ireland?
<p></p>Recenttly I read about halloween in a national geographic article. It explained how there is a sacred "mound" of dirt that thousands of years ago was used to host annual rituals. Scientists believe these rituals are the predececcors to halloween.
