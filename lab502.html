This is my second attempt at making a first web page. I feel that I am not very good at this stuff and it is very difficult. Hopefully if I ever try this stuff again in the future It won't feel so hard.
  <p>This is me trying againâ€¦</p>


  I'm doing very well in all my other classes, this is the exception. I have straight A's in everything else but this class is kicking my butt. Hopefully I am able to pass.</p>
